Firstly I suggest you to create a work dir, and put all the scripts, genome and annotation files into it, and do all the following in that dir.

After generated VCF files, copy them into a new directory (such as <vcf_dir>) under the work dir.
Then you can use the scripts as following order.

perl 00.note_all.pl genome.gff vcf_dir test00 
perl 01.sort_into_snp_indel.pl test00 test01_snp test01_indel
perl 02.count_SNP.pl -c 4061950 test01_snp test02_countSNP
perl 03.dnds.pl -f genome.fa -d test01_snp -b blosum62.txt -o dnds_out.txt

some other scripts I used were in others.
