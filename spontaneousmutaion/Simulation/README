Here are the scripts I used to generate the random simulation data, I also suggest working in a new directory, the order to use them is as following:

perl split.pl genome.fa
perl note_list.pl genome.gff3 ref_CG.txt ref_CG_note.txt
perl note_list.pl genome.gff3 ref_AT.txt ref_AT_note.txt
perl mc.pl ref_AT_note.txt ref_CG_note.txt
